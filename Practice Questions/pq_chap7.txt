re.compile() returns Regex objects
Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped
return the first match objects
re.group() returs strings of the matched text
group(0) = all, group(1)=(\d\d\d), group(2)=(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)
\( and \. () : groups and . : any character exept \n
if there is groups or not
either, or
? = possibility or non-greedy matching
+ = one or more, * = zero or more
{3} = 3 times, {3,5}= between 3 and 5 times
\d = digit, \w = word, \s = space
\D = not digit, \W = not word, \S = not space
.* = greedy match, .* = non-greedy match
[0-9a-z] or [a-z0-9]
reI = make the matching case insensitive
dot character matches \d and \w not \n DOTALL = include \newline
X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens
The re.VERBOSE argument allows you to add whitespace and comments to the string passed to re.compile().
re.compile(r'^\d{1,3}(,\d{3})*$')
re.compile(r'[A-Z][a-z]*\sWatanabe')
re.compile(r'(Ã‚lice|Bob|Carol)\(neats|pets|throws)\n(apples|cats|baseballs)\.', re.I)
